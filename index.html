        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>This part of the Jenkins User Documentation contains a series of introductory tutorials to help you begin building your applications in an automated fashion with Jenkins.

If you’re a developer who wants to improve your understanding of Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Delivery (CD) concepts, or you might already be familiar with these concepts but don’t yet know how to implement them in Jenkins, then these tutorials are a great place to start.</p>
